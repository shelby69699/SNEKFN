# VERCEL BUILD FIX

## Issue:
Vercel was deploying old commit `ec76931` with faker imports instead of latest commit `6ff2b64` without faker.

## Solution:
1. ✅ Confirmed NO faker imports exist in current code
2. ✅ Force pushed latest commit to trigger fresh deployment
3. ✅ Local build works perfectly

## Current Status:
- Latest commit: 6ff2b64 (faker completely removed)
- Build status: ✅ SUCCESS (no faker dependencies)
- Deployment: Fresh push triggered

This file will be removed after successful Vercel deployment.
